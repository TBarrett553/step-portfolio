            <h1>Teanna Barrett’s Portfolio</h1>
        </a>
        <p>Hello I’m Teanna Barrett and this is my portfolio. 
            I'm creating this portfolio for my second week project as a part of the STEP internship. 
            I not only wanted to share my professional side, I want to personally  introduce myself. 
            I have structured this app as a choose your own adventure of sorts. Each panel of the webpage 
            will have some information about me and choices displayed at the bottom. As you continue to 
            pick choices you will be able to learn specific things about me and the work I hope to do as 
            a Computer Scientist. Once you reach the last panel, you will then be directed to a Guest Book 
            of sorts. This will allow you to write a short message and record that you have participated 
            in my little project. Then you will be redirected to the beginning so you can try a new path. 
            Thank you for doing this and have fun!
        </p>

        <img src="Images/jamaica_flag.jpg" alt= "The flag of Jamaica" style="width:50%;height=auto;"> 
        <p>I’m the daughter of Jamaican immigrants.  I spent most of my childhood in Florida and 
            my parents raised me to be very proud of my heritage. I grew up around Jamaican food, 
            music, and culture, therefore I’m very proud of my Jamaican heritage. I have travelled 
            to Jamaica to visit my family a couple of times. I have a younger sister, an older brother, 
            and an older sister. I really enjoy sharing meals, watching movies, and playing games with my family.

            <h1>What I Do (and What I Am Doing)</h1>
        </a>
        <p>I’m still a rising sophomore at Howard University so I have a lot of things 
            I plan to accomplish on my journey towards becoming a Computer Scientist. 
            I still have so much to learn and do but that’s why I’m in this internship 
            in the first place! If you want to learn about what I have done so far choose 
            the “Present Accomplishments” button. If you want to learn about my overall goals 
            and future aspirations choose the “Future Outlook” button.

            <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
        </a>
        <p>My central goal is fairly straightforward. I aim to gain technical skills 
            in Computer Science so the world can be a better place to live for everyone. 
            I keep myself on track with general professional and social impact goals.

            <h2>Professional/Academic Goals</h2>
        </a>
        <ol>
            <li>Earn a Computer Science undergraduate degree (with a minor in Economics)</li>
            <li>Earn a Master’s in Data Science</li>
            <li>Earn a PhD in Economics with a Concentration in Data Science and Social Justice</li>
            <li>Conduct Academic or Professional Research in Social Justice Reform with Data Science</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This plan is very tentative. I have no idea how my goals will change over time but this is my 
            ideal plan right now.

            <h2>Social Impact Goals</h2>
        </a>
        <p>There is a lot of inequality in our society today (racial, gender, class, etc) that needs to be 
            amended. Our society has come a long way but I believe that technology can be used to make more 
            comprehensive changes to our world for the better. More specifically, I want to build technology 
            that directly addresses injustice and provides effective solutions. In order to do this, I aim 
            to work thoughtfully, honestly, and to be held accountable.
